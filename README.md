# Object Detection with YOLOR and RetinaNet

This repository contains code and resources for an object detection project using YOLOR and RetinaNet models. The project utilizes Roboflow for data preprocessing and labeling. The main objective is to detect and classify objects in images accurately.

## Introduction

This project focuses on building and training object detection models using YOLOR and RetinaNet. Object detection is a key task in computer vision, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within images. By leveraging the power of deep learning models, we aim to achieve high accuracy in detecting various objects.

## Features

- **Preprocessing with Roboflow:** Utilize Roboflow for dataset labeling, augmentation, and preprocessing.
- **Multi-Model Approach:** Train and compare two state-of-the-art object detection models, YOLOR and RetinaNet.
- **Customizable Training Pipeline:** Easily modify the training parameters and settings to suit your dataset and requirements.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using standard object detection metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision).
- **Inference:** Perform inference on new images using the trained models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
